# HeiAd

I implemented the solution based on the following:
 
- UITaleViewController, Core Data as cache and a simple JSON Parser that extracts the values required in this challenge only
- classic solution on the basis of the interface builder functions
- saving and updating of the ads
- favourite function

Extern lib
- SDWeImage for the remote image caching
 
 
Improvement could be:
 
- deleting those ads that are no longer available in the interface, but only if they are not favourized by the user
- handling of exceptions including displaying error messages to the user
- Test by another person
